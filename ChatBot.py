# Instructions on how to use the chatbot
print("""
Welcome to the Friendly Chatbot!
This chatbot is here to talk about your day and respond in a way that matches your mood.
Simply type something about your day, like how you're feeling or what you've been up to.
The chatbot will try to understand your emotions based on keywords you use.
If it doesn't understand, it will ask you to teach it new words and responses.
Type 'bye' anytime to end the conversation. Have fun chatting!
